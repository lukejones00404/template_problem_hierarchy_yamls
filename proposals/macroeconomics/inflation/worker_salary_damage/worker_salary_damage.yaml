# {~C~} This describes the problem.  You may want to edit this in your proposal. {~C~}
describe_problem_area: |
  This does an approximation of the theft to citizens by rigged econony at the macroeconomic level.
  This is the "UMBRELLA", which is an estimation of all macroeconomics.  Over time, it will go away when each area
  within macroeconomics is mapped out.
  
  Here is an anology: A hamster is on a hamster wheel. 
      a) IN AN UNRIGGED MARKET, the hamster works (walking on the wheel) when s/he wants money for food and things 
         they want. They rest when don't want to work.  Watch an NOT-rigged economy where workers aren't stolen from.
	 Between years 1800 to 1899 inflation was about -7% (deflation) because
	 of the gold standard, money printing nearly couldn't happen. This is strategically critical for workers.
	 Worker's salary doubled from 1801 to 1899, such as a young worker in their first job after finishing school.
         Inflation went DOWN 7% (aka deflation) from 1801 to 1899.  This is needed for capitalism to allow workers to
	 succeed.  A person 1 year into working after school graduation has 200% the salary in 1899 than in 1801 and
	 the cost of everything went down 7%.  Buying a house, horse, bicycle, food all became a far better quality of
	 life.  Here capitalism naturally will give the workers their fair share of GDP and GDP growth, as long as money printing
	 doesn't shift wealth in a rigged economy to the economic elites.
	 
     b) WHEN MACROECONOMICS IS RIGGED: The economic elites want workers (hamsters) to have to ALWAYS run on the hamster wheel.
        They want the hamster to drown if they don't.  When macroeconomics shifts from NO money printing (1801 to 1899), then workers greatly benefit from the economy.  They receive the GDP gains and they aren't stolen from by inflation in  products.  The government reports 2% inflation, but true NON-Rigged inflation (ShadowStats.com) is 7% YoY. Real citizens know this in Rent increases, housing price increases, healthcare increases, university cost increases, food increases and everything else increasing with inflation.  When these things happen: a) money printing, b) government laying about inflation (rigging CPI calcuations by including the wrong things), c) and other behavior  in macroeconomics and worker relations, then it rigs the economy:
	a) 1801-1899 their salaries doubled (same industry experience), so they benefit.   2000 to 2020 shows workers at (and near) minimum wage not getting any increase.
	b) 1801-1899 has -7% inflation over 100 years (aka deflation). They benefit in the cost of living.  
	   2000-2020: The true inflation (ShadowStats.com) is 7% YoY, but the government lies at 2% YoY.  Workers
	        			      are economically devistated by the ONE-TWO punch of salaries not going up, and inflation going up.
		     
     All of this is RIGGED on purpose. Companies and investors are making workers work far more.  Workers get less and less
     every year, because inflation equates to SALARY DECREASES yearly (on an inflation adjusted basis).
     
     This /macoroeconomics/all_summary/ will focus on a) Money Printing, b) Gov lying about true inflation, and
     c) Other macroeconomic methods that make workers work harder and get less.

  a) Workers lock-in their salary when they start a company. Inflation eats away aggressively at their salary.
     Economists think workers will always get raises aggressively to fully counter inflation but that doesn't happen.  
     Especially and specifically to a large base of employees who simply can't or don't put pressure on the employer of them
     leaving if they don't.
  b) The US Gov likes to say inflation is 2%. However after ~1985, the government started heavily manipulating the
     way inflation was calculated. It doesn't include so much of what is true inflation for citizens. 2% YoY is not
     true in the real world inflation of rent, buying a house, their university costs, medical costs, medicine costs and
     everything in the real world. Uncover the US Gov lying about true inflation and you caught a big part of
     rigged economy theft in the macroeconomics area.
     i) See shadowstats.com. They show how the government's official inflation rate doesn't track the real inflation or CPI
        that citizens face.
  c) Citizens may ethically approve SOME money printing, but most is often rigged economy to transfer wealth to rigged economy 
     theft recipients (economic elites). "Money printing" includes electronic money (aka non-paper money) in the US dollar currency asset class increasing. 
       i) 2008 Mortgage crisis had Monetary Base money increase US Dollars from $800 billion to $3.8 trillion.
          Most of that directly (or indirectly) is just transferred to the wealthiest in the country.
       ii) 2020 Covid: Exterme money printing should have helped citizens. But instead it effective had nearly all of it
           just be a transfer to the wealthy or largest corporations (least at risk of going out of business)
       iii) In non-crisis, money printing when the dust settles just transfers to the wealthiest.
   d) In a free market with sound money (no money printing), the inflation will be far far lower.  Workers must have
      this since their salaries are locked-in when they start a job. The truth is that worker pay raises are never
      fully include true inflation plus more for their growing skillset and growing contribution.
   e) We must calculate how much ethical inflation would be without the part of money printing that is 
      concidered unethical.  We will calculate a normal citizen's career.  We will show that they will lose
      incredible amounts due to rigged economy inflation taking away their wealth (in terms of buying power).
      We will turn this into a dollar amount stolen.

reasoning: |
    1) Does the US government's official inflation number lower than the true number?
    2) Does the US government's official inflation rate calculations unethically leave out critical things, so the inflation rate is artificially too low?
    3) The economic elite's rigged economy creates economic crisis (S&L bailouts, 2008 Mortgage Bailouts, etc.).  
       Does the money-printing pretty quickly just transfer to the economic elites?  In the 2020 Covid crisis,
       incredible money printing happened. That wealth appeared to be moved indirectly but quickly to the economic elites,
       as can be seen by the stock market going so high, when company revenues where going so low.
    4) Find quote on 1801 to 1899 had 7% DEFLATION over that ~100 years. AND the supply of gold greatly increased on two occasions.  People's salary DOUBLED (because of GDP growth) but with -7% inflation everything was cheaper to buy. ~~~Find this quote~~~~  "Free Market Cure" by John Allison.

    TOPIC: "JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CHARGES 24 MAJOR NASDAQ SECURITIES FIRMS WITH FIXING TRANSACTION COSTS FOR INVESTORs"
    URL:  https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/1996/July96/343-at.html
    DESCRIPTION: >
      The Department's investigation began in the summer of 1994, shortly after the publication of an economic study by Professors William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul Schultz of Ohio State University about the Nasdaq market.

     The quoting convention imposes a penalty on Nasdaq market makers who want to narrow the "inside spread" in a stock. Because of this penalty--increased risk of trading the stock on the "wrong" side of the market--market makers had an incentive to avoid using eighth-point increments to update their stock quotes. The result has been that the inside spreads in a significant number of Nasdaq stocks have been wider than they would have been in a competitive market. This meant that investors were paying higher trading costs for buying and selling stocks on the Nasdaq market.

     The Department said that new traders were trained to update their price quotes in quarters for stocks with wide dealer spreads, and taught that quoting those stocks in eighths was unethical and unprofessional. The Department alleged that market makers used peer pressure to enforce the agreement.  A market maker who deviated from the quoting convention might be told-- "You're spoiling it for everybody."

    DESCRIPTION: >
      On the New York Stock Exchange, by contrast, spreads for most stocks are 1/8 of a point, or 12.5 cents, an NYSE spokeswoman said.

      The professors found that for 71 out of 100 of the largest Nasdaq stocks, market makers seemed never to quote prices in “odd eighths” of a point. In other words, bid or asked prices could be 20, 20 1/4, 20 1/2 or 20 3/4, but never 20 1/8, 20 3/8, 20 5/8 or 20 7/8--even though such quotes are common for other stocks.

      The direct result was that spreads in these stocks were never less than 1/4 of a point. And the wider spreads end up costing investors, in the aggregate, millions of dollars every year.

      Christie and Schulz concluded that the only possible explanation for the spreads was “tacit collusion” among market makers.

      Shortly after their report was made public, spreads for a few of the stocks they cited--including Apple, Microsoft and Thousand Oaks-based Amgen Inc.--suddenly narrowed to 1/8 of a point.

    URL: "https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/nd21a-report.txt"
    DESCRIPTION: >
      The evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that Nasdaq market makers followed and in some cases overtly enforced a pricing convention that was used to determine the increments in which they would adjust their displayed quotes. This practice resulted in most stocks being quoted only in increments of $1/4.  Market makers testified that under the convention, stocks in which dealers were quoting spreads of $3/4 or more were to be quoted in even-eighths (i.e., $1/4, $1/2, $3/4), thereby giving rise to a minimum inside spread of $1/4 ("even-eighth stocks"). Stocks with dealer spreads less than $3/4 could be quoted in both even and odd-eighths, thereby allowing a minimum inside spread of $1/8. The dealer spread was understood by market makers as indicating which of the two quotation increments applied to a particular security The Nasdaq pricing convention was generally treated by market makers as a pricing "ethic," "tradition," or "professional norm" that other market makers were expected to follow, and was sometimes enforced through harassment, or threatened or actual refusals to deal. This pricing convention both directly and indirectly restricted the independent pricing decisions of individual market makers, and thereby negatively impacted price competition. Pricing and quoting decisions independently arrived at by individual market participants do not, in and of themselves, raise the same anticompetitive concerns.
   
      The existence of this pricing convention is confirmed through analysis of the price and quote data in the Nasdaq market. Prior to May 1994, more than 80% of all domestic Nasdaq NMS stocks (more than 3,200 stocks) followed the pricing convention. Of the more than 1,900 domestic NMS stocks greater than $10, more than 90% followed the pricing convention and approximately 78% were even-eighth stocks. Among the 100 most actively traded domestic Nasdaq stocks, at least 96% of them followed the convention and 66% of them had dealer spreads of $3/4 or greater.

    DESCRIPTION: >
      If the costs of living these days seems to be rising faster than the official 1.3% inflation rate, there’s a reason. The annual inflation rate for Covid-connected purchases is 1.85%, or a half percentage point higher than the Consumer Price Index, according according to Harvard Business School professor Alberto Cavallo.

    DESCRIPTION: >
      Our real-world experience tells us the official inflation rate doesn’t reflect the actual cost increases of everything from burritos to healthcare. In our household, we measure inflation with the Burrito Index. How much has the cost of a regular burrito at our favorite taco truck gone up. 
      
      Since we keep detailed records of expenses (a necessity if you’re a self-employed free-lance writer), I can track the real-world inflation of the Burrito Index with great accuracy. The cost of a regular burrito from our local taco truck has gone up from $2.50 in 2001 to $5 in 2010 to $6.50 in 2016. That’s a $160% increase since 2001; 15 years in which the official inflation rate reports that what $1 bought in 2001 can supposedly be bought with $1.35 today. This enormous loss of purchasing power is not reflected in the official measure of inflation, which claims inflation is subdued (1% or so annually).

      If the Burrito Index had tracked official inflation, the burrito at our truck should cost $3.38 — up only 35% from 2001. Compare that to today’s actual cost of $6.50 — almost double what it “should cost” according to official inflation calculations.

      Since 2001, the real-world burrito index is 4.5 times greater than the official rate of inflation — not a trivial difference

    TOPIC: "Why Is the Consumer Price Index Controversial?"
    URL: "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp"
    DESCRIPTION: >
      The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) produces the Consumer Price Index (CPI). It is the most widely watched and used measure of the U.S. inflation rate. It is also used to determine the real gross domestic product (GDP). From an investor's perspective, the CPI, as a proxy for inflation, is a critical measure that can be used to estimate the total return, on a nominal basis, required for an investor to meet their financial goals.
      
      For several years, there has been controversy about whether the CPI overstates or understates inflation, how it is measured, and whether it is an appropriate proxy for inflation. One of the primary reasons for this contention is that economists differ on how they feel inflation should be measured.
      
      Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.2﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI.
      
      John Williams, a U.S. economist, and analyst of government reporting, prefers a CPI, or inflation measure, calculated using the original methodology based on a basket of goods having quantities and qualities fixed.3﻿
      
      David Ranson, another U.S. economist, also questions the official CPI's viability as an indicator of inflation. Unlike Williams, Ranson does not espouse the viewpoint that the CPI is manipulated. Instead, Ranson's view is that the CPI is a lagging indicator of inflation and is not a good indicator of current inflation. According to Ranson, increases in the price of commodities are a better indicator of current inflation because inflation initially affects commodity prices, and it may take several years for this commodity inflation to work its way through an economy and to be reflected in the CPI. Ranson bases his inflation measure on a commodity basket of precious metals.
      
      The different methods of measuring inflation produce disparate indications of inflation for the same period. For example, the November 2006 Consumer Price Index Summary, which is published by the BLS, stated that "During the first 11 months of 2006, the CPI-U rose at a 2.2% seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR)."5﻿ Williams' estimate of CPI for the same period was 5.3%, while Ranson's reported an 8.2% estimate.

    DESCRIPTION: >
      It works like magic. With a few strokes on a computer, the Federal Reserve can create dollars out of nothing, virtually "printing" money and injecting it into the commercial banking system, much like an electronic deposit. By the end of the year, the Fed is projected to have purchased $3.5 trillion in government securities with these newly created dollars, one of many tools it is using to help prop up the ailing economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Oxford Economics. “The way you and I have checking accounts in our banks, that’s how all these other banks have accounts at the Fed,” said Pavlina Tcherneva, an economist at Bard College in New York. “All the Fed does is literally credit them. They just type it in.”
      
      The Fed's goal: to keep markets functioning after they had seized up in fear. The strategy also makes credit easier to obtain, with a bigger money supply and lower interest rates. Without these and the Fed's other emergency measures, the economy would have crashed already, experts say. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a recent news conference that these purchases have helped market conditions improve "substantially" in recent weeks.  
      
      The Federal Reserve doesn’t literally print paper dollars. That’s the job of the U.S. Treasury, which also collects taxes and issues debt at the direction of Congress. At this time of crisis, the Fed instead makes large asset purchases on the open market by adding newly created electronic dollars to the reserves of banks such as Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. In exchange, the Fed receives large amounts of bonds – U.S. Treasury securities and agency securities that are backed by bundles of home mortgages. 
      
      Does 'creating' money create an inflation risk?
      Paul, the former Texas congressman and author of "End the Fed," predicts such money creation will lead to disaster. He says it will cause overheated financial bubbles fueled by too much easy money in the system – a bubble that could burst with painful fallout. Creating too much money that chases too few goods also leads to price inflation, decreasing the purchasing power of the dollar.

      With the Federal Reserve and Congress pushing stimulus efforts to new heights, some investors are keeping a close eye on a surge in the U.S. money supply for signs of inflation’s long-awaited return.

    URL: "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/were-there-any-periods-major-deflation-us-history.asp"
    DESCRIPTION: >
	There have been several deflationary periods in U.S. history, including between 1817 and 1860, and again between 1865 to 1900. The most dramatic deflationary period in U.S. history took place between 1930 and 1933, during the Great Depression. Deflation rarely occurred in the second half of the 20th century. In fact, the dramatic and consistent price increases from 1950 to 2000 has been unparalleled since the founding of the country. 

	During the period between 1873 and 1879, prices dropped by nearly three percent every year, yet real national product growth was at almost seven percent during the same time period. However, despite this economic growth and the rise of real wages, historians have called this period "The Long Depression" because of the presence of deflation.

	During the Great Depression, deflation was the result of a collapsing financial sector and bank failures. The deflation that took place at the outset of the Great Depression was the most dramatic that the U.S. has ever experienced. Prices dropped an average of ten percent every year between the years of 1930 and 1933.

    DESCRIPTION: >
	For inflation, first you should know that price deflation used to be common, and often accompanied depressions, which were also common.  The 1820s and 1830s were nasty, and there was a "long depression" from the 1870s to 1900 or so, then another financial crisis in 1907. The civil war was a period of particularly unstable prices, no surprise, as was WWI, the Great Depression, and WWII.  But after that, even though the average inflation rate was higher on average, price inflation became more stable.  In economic theory, it is the predictability of inflation that matters more than the rate. Notice too that the average growth rate was also higher after WWII, so one cannot argue that mildly higher average inflation hurt growth.
